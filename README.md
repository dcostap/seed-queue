# seed-queue

Automatic1111 extension that allows you to store current txt2img preview's generation image seed & prompt.

Then you can re-generate everything stored. Useful to regenerate a batch of chosen images with high-res fix or whatever.

This was done hastily and the implementation is really hacky (just check the comments :D) so it may break in no time.
